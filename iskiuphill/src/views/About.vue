	<p class='is-10'>We're a group of uphill skiers that have found it difficult to find
	and understand uphill ski policies at various resorts. As we slowly compiled a list of uphill policies for some local hills we decided to expand on that and build out a centralized place to store and keep those policies up-to-date as well as summarize them in a manner that is easy to understand.

	As such we're looking to expand the current website to be a resource for the community and we hope that we can rely on community contributions to enhance the information on the site.
